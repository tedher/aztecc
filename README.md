Introduction
------------

This repository contains my bachelor thesis title "Implementing Encryption/Decryption Program using Elliptic Curve Cryptography" and the source code of the program generated from the thesis.

Requirements
------------

To compile the code you need LiDIA (Library for computational number theory) version 1.3.3. At this moment, I can't find the LiDIA 1.3.3 library anymore.
